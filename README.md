# Capstone-Project
Measuring Impact and Updating AI Model for a banking/financial services AI product use case

As a product manager, I am constantly looking to improve machine learning models and products by applying proven strategies to mitigate bias, scale a product, and continuously update models.

The problem the capstone project is trying to solve in the banking/financial services industry is to reduce processing time it takes to enroll business clients for Cash Management Services, and make the service accessible and available to clients in a faster time frame.

Capstone Project focused on:  
• Traditional Machine Learning approach (which works better with smaller datasets) instead of Deep Learning approach (which outperforms with large datasets)
• Scanned images as input data
